# Score-Predictor-GUI-using-python-scikitlearn-and-tKinter
## This was my first project for my college grading purpose
* In this project my aim was to predict the first innings total of a cricket match for a given instance.
* This also contains a Graphical User Interface(GUI) done with the help of tKinter in python
* In the GUI the model used was simply a Linear Regression(since we are predicting a continuous value)
* In the Notebook three Regression techniques has been use
  * Linear Regression
  * Decision Tree Regressor
  * Random Forest Regressor
* Modules used in the notebook are
  * Numpy - for handling matrices
  * Pandas - to read and manipulate the data
  * Matplotlib/Seaborn - to visualize the data/Exploratory Data Analysis
  * Scikit-Learn - for implementing the Machine Learning algorithms
* I collected the data from [Cricsheet](https://cricsheet.org/downloads/)
